#         description: |
#           Designed and built a framework for easy deployment of IoT in-home
#           sensor network for epidemiologists. The framework uses Raspberry
#           Pis and open source software to interoperate with many different
#           types of IoT sensors. It allows for easy experimentation and data
#           collection. The system has been deployed in multiple homes in
#           Utah as part of a pediatric asthma research study.

#           an easy to use tool to export data from the database, peak detect
#           algorithm for anomaly detection, a participant text notifications
#           system to alert and receive feedback from participants, and an API
#           for external tools to query data.

#           password with unassociated wireless sensors by encoding data into
#           Ethernet source and destination addresses. This greatly speeds up
#           the time it takes to connect IoT devices to a home's wireless
