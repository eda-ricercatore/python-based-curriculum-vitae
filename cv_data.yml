#         description: |
#           Designed and built a framework for easy deployment of IoT in-home
#           sensor network for epidemiologists. The framework uses Raspberry
#           Pis and open source software to interoperate with many different
#           types of IoT sensors. It allows for easy experimentation and data
#           collection. The system has been deployed in multiple homes in
#           Utah as part of a pediatric asthma research study.

              Thoroughly studied the benefits of using asynchronous I/O
              compared to synchronous I/O for all network communication.
              Developed new method for managing multiple TCP connections
              with neighboring nodes. Built Android application and deployed
              on 15 devices in the field to measure the improvements.
              Collaborated closely with three other researchers to improve
              various components of the system.

    title: Duplicate Image Finder
    link: https://github.com/philipbl/duplicate-images
    description: >
      Using perspective hashing, I built a tool that detects duplicate images in photo libraries. It has over 100 stars on GitHub and I have worked with contributors to make the project better.

  - start: 2015
    title: Home Assistant
    link: https://www.home-assistant.io
    description: >
      Core contributor to open source home automation hub software. Allows for different third party home automation systems to be integrated easily and controlled from a centralized location.

  # - start: 2014
  #   title: Personal Blog
  #   description: >
  #     Short articles with small coding projects. One such project has been written about in several blogs, including Cult of Mac.
  # - start: 2013
  #   title: Day One Adobe Lightroom Plugin
  #   description: >
  #     Built a plugin that allows users to export photos from Adobe Lightroom to the Mac journaling application, Day One. Open sourced plugin on GitHub, with some popularity. Added features and fixed bugs based on user feedback. Plugin receives about 30 views every day on GitHub.
  # - start: 2010 to 2011
  #   title: Y-Clops
  #   description: >
  #     Worked with a large group to build an autonomous robot for Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. Worked specifically on the robot’s camera using OpenCV to recognize obstacles. Used image-processing techniques such as edge detection and thresholding to detect obstacles.
